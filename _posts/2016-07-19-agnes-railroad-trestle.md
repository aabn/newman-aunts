One of the often-told stories about [Agnes]({{site.baseurl}}/agnes) is that when she was a teenager, she and her friends were caught by the police while walking on a railroad trestle, which was against the law. The police took her to the Justice of the Peace--who happened to be her father Jacob.

Like most stories about the Newman aunts, I want to know more, yet my family knows little about the incident, and I've been unable to find any documentation--a newspaper article, a police report, or a legal record--that fills in the gaps. It makes sense: after all, if the police had just deposited Agnes with her father--"here's your daughter, sir, and we're sure you'll punish her fairly wink wink"--no documentary trace would have been left.

This is a problem that I have encountered many times in my research, and one that I am sure I will continue to come up against as this project progresses. There are limited sources that documented people's lives in the early 20th century, and of these sources, even fewer that have been preserved and/or digitized and made publicly available. ([Open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access), anyone?) As much as I want to know every detail about an event from the past, in some cases, my explorations will take a different path.

In this story, what is compelling is a place--an unknown [railroad trestle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trestle_bridge)--so I decided to make that the focus of my investigation. In understanding the place, we can contextualize our understanding of Agnes, painting a richer portrait of a young woman in the world in which she lived.

According to an 1895 railroad map, there were two railroad lines that traveled to the Newmans' hometown of Waynesboro, Pennsylvania: the Western Maryland and Cumberland Valley Railroads.

The [Waynesboro Branch](http://www.abandonedrails.com/Waynesboro_Branch) line, operated by the Cumberland Valley Railroad, was a branch off of the Hagerstown, MD, to Harrisburg, PA, line, and appears to have ended just to the north of the town center. And on the Waynesboro Branch line was a promising possibility for the railroad trestle in question: [Price's Trestle](http://www.wmwestsub.com/waynesborobranch/pricestrestle.htm), a wooden bridge over Antietam Creek and Price's Church Road, a little over a mile from the home where Agnes was living at the time, on North Grant Street.

Also known as "the Foltz Meadow railroad trestle," the bridge was "well known to generations of Waynesboro area residents [and] built shortly after the Baltimore and Cumberland Valley Railroad Extension Company started an extension to Chambersburg in 1880." (*Around Waynesboro*, p. 96) [RailPictures.net](http://www.railpictures.net/photo/357597/) has a photo of the trestle from 1976, depicting an extensive wooden structure traversing a low-lying meadow.

The trestle was also the site of multiple accidents and deaths, which speaks to the sense of danger that would have surrounded it at the time--therefore making it a risky spot for a group of teenagers.

From *The Harrisburg Telegraph*, September 30, 1898:

>It was John Mingle who was killed by a Western Maryland freight train on Price's trestle, near Waynesboro, Tuesday morning.

And from *The Evening News*, July 13, 1920:

>Kenneth Weagley, 9-year-old son of Mrs. Paul I. Criswell, of this place, was struck by a Western Maryland passenger train yesterday, the accident occurring on the trestle near Price's, located a short distance from the local station. ... The boy was playing skinning the cat on the trestle and did not see the approaching train in time to get under the timbers.

Sadly, the trestle no longer exists, but there remain some wooden posts and what looks like a stone ramp.

The dismantling of the trestle in 1985 "effectively marked the end of Waynesboro's 100-year era of railroad access." (*Around Waynesboro*, p. 96) When the railroad first arrived in Waynesboro in 1879, it brought with it modern industry, including the Landis Tool and Machine Companies. These companies helped build the town and employed many Newman men, including my great-grandfather Samuel (Agnes's older brother), who went on to be the president of Landis Tool. In many ways, Price's trestle was a symbol of progress and modernization, a link to the outside world for a small rural town at the turn of the century.

If this was the scene of Agnes's transgression, it was appropriate. Born in 1895, she was the youngest child in the family, and she grew up in a world that was vastly different than even the world her oldest sister Babbie had experienced growing up only two decades earlier.

"We must see [a character] set to scale in his proper world to know his size," writes Eudora Welty in her essay, ["Place in Fiction."](http://xroads.virginia.edu/%7EDRBR/welty.txt) She was speaking of how place defines characters, guiding our vision of them, and preventing a too wide or a too narrow view. Similarly, setting this story of Agnes in a place guides our vision of her. We see her actions within a context of history and family, and this helps us to understand Agnes in her world--a young woman coming of age in a quickly changing era.
