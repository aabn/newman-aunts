On May 15, 1894, the first of the Newman aunts left home to start a new life. In a quiet ceremony at the Newman family house near Waynesboro, Barbara "Babbie" Newman, the oldest of the six sisters, married Jacob Abner Miller, a teacher and the son of Cumberland County farmers. When Babbie left home, most of her siblings were still under the age of twelve; her youngest sister, Agnes, would not even be born until the following year (making Agnes only a year older than her nephew, Babbie's first son Frederick, who was born in 1896).

As the oldest daughter, and with so many young children in the house, Babbie probably had to assume many responsibilities at a young age. One can only imagine the nature of her transition from helping her mother care for a large family to being the wife of a schoolteacher, and, eventually, mother to five.

Besides being the first to marry, Babbie was also the aunt with the longest marriage; when Jacob succumbed to congestive heart failure in 1948, they had been married for 54 years. During that time, Jacob changed careers twice, resigning from teaching to become a railway mail clerk, and then working at the Landis Machine Company with his brother-in-law Samuel. While the children were still young, the Millers lived in Rixford (Pennsylvania), New York, and Pittsburgh, before returning to Waynesboro--although they would continue to move from house to house until 1940, when they settled on South Church Street, only a few blocks away from Samuel and his family. Babbie and Jacob's five children embarked on varied and interesting lives, though none would remain in Waynesboro.

Babbie outlived Jacob by twenty years, dying in 1968 at the age of 95. Yet most of those 95 years remain undocumented. Babbie's obituary from the *Waynesboro Record Herald* lists the details of her death, her survivors, and funeral plans, but of her life says simply: "Most of her life was lived in the Waynesboro area."

Babbie suffers from the fate of most 20th century housewives: they are hidden from history, overshadowed by stories of wars and elections. The same is true for our family history: Babbie is overshadowed by her more career-oriented sisters. We have very few stories about Babbie, and they all pretty much start and end with: "She married Jacob Miller." Over the course of this project, I hope to change that, to develop a deeper understanding of Babbie's life, and the contributions that she has made, to her family and to society.
