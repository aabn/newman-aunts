In two previous posts, I’ve shared the story of how Eve became active in the rural settlement school movement in Kentucky, serving as field secretary for both the Hindman Settlement School and the Pine Mountain Settlement School. Now, I’ll be telling the end of that story, of how, after several years of raising money and support for the work of progressive-minded women in the Kentucky mountains, Eve left Pine Mountain.

By 1915, the Pine Mountain Settlement School was well on its way to becoming a successful school and community center. New buildings were going up, more students were enrolling, and nursing and other community services were expanding.

Eve’s role at the school was expanding as well. In February of 1915, she was elected to Pine Mountain’s General Advisory Board. ([Letter from Marguerite Butler, 2/24/1915](https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?attachment_id=12234)) The board was a group of advisors, selected by the Executive Committee, which had “the power to direct and shape the policies of the school, to vote at all Board meetings, and to control the actions of the Board of Trustees.” ([Board Report, January 3, 1914](https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?attachment_id=4873))

In 1915, Eve also took up the cause to have a road built from Pine Mountain to the nearest railroad. A *Louisville Courier-Journal* article from April 20, 1915, related news of a meeting that took place between Eve and Road Commissioner R.C. Terrell “concerning State aid work in Harlan. The county failed to apply in time, and Miss Newman said she intends to urge the county officers to make their plans this year so as to take advantage of the State aid plan next year.” (“Harlan Woman Seeks State Aid for County,” *The Courier-Journal*, April 21, 1915) (N.B. The road over Pine Mountain was not actually completed until 1940, according to a [history of the “Laden Trail” published on the Pine Mountain Settlement School Collections website](https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?p=4736).)

Despite Eve’s continued activities with Pine Mountain, by fall 1915, she was planning to leave the school, if only for a short time. In a letter dated early fall 1915, Marguerite Butler reported: “Miss Newman, the regular secretary, is leaving for a year’s study at Columbia.” ([Letter from Marguerite Butler, early fall 1915](https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?attachment_id=12266))

There is no mention of whether Eve intended to return to Pine Mountain after completing her studies, but, if so, her plans changed.

On December 31, 1915, Eve’s father, Jacob Newman, justice of the peace in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, signed a marriage license application for Eve, then a 27-year-old student, and Alan Pegram Gilmour, a 45-year-old attorney from Lexington, Kentucky. They were married in Waynesboro on February 12, 1916.

I have always wondered how Eve met Alan Gilmour--an older man, established attorney, son of a wealthy Scottish tobacco merchant, captain in the Kentucky National Guard, and “prominent citizen”--according to the Louisville Courier-Journal. (The Courier-Journal, January 2, 1916). Some deep digging revealed that Alan practiced law in the same building as Charles Wilson, who sat on the Board of Trustees of the Pine Mountain Settlement School, but this was the only connection that I could find… until I stumbled upon a newspaper article that offered an answer to this mystery.

>Lincoln's birthday anniversary on February 12 will be celebrated by Capt. Alan P. Gilmour, of this city, the well-known lecturer on 'Abraham Lincoln,' by his marriage on that day to Miss Eve Newman, the wedding to be held at the home of Miss Newman's sister in Columbia, N.Y.

>The marriage will be the direct result of a romance brought about through the subject of Lincoln. Last summer Miss Newman, whose home is in Waynesboro, Pa., was visiting Miss Katherine Pettet [sic] at the Pine Mountain School in Eastern Kentucky when Capt. Gilmour went over there to deliver his lecture on Abraham Lincoln at a Fourth of July celebration. He is an enthusiast on the subject and made the lecture so interesting and eloquent that Miss Newman, who was in the audience, became attracted by what he had to say, and, meeting later, Mr. Gilmour began to pay court and so is now preparing to carry out his plan of celebrating Lincoln's birthday with this most important event of his life.

("Lincoln Lecture Won Her," *The Courier Journal*, January 31, 1916)

This entertaining account of their courtship leaves me with so many unanswered questions: How often did Alan make the arduous trek over the mountain from Lexington to “pay court”? If Eve and Alan were engaged by the end of the year, when did Eve leave Pine Mountain? And how much of an “enthusiast” of Lincoln was Alan?

The last question proved easiest to answer. Newspaper articles show that Alan Gilmour was indeed an enthusiast of Abraham Lincoln. At the Lexington Memorial Day services in 1913, he recited Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. (*The Courier-Journal*, May 26, 1913) He also offered a prize of “$5 in gold” to the Lincoln Model School student who gave the “best rendition of Lincoln’s Gettysburg speech” and presented to the school “a large, elegantly framed facsimilie [sic] in blue print of the tablets placed in all our national cemeteries, upon which are engraved the immortal address.” (*The Courier-Journal*, October 10, 1913) A few years later, Alan would even publish an article on the “Patriotism of Lincoln” in *The Kentucky Magazine*. (“The Kentucky Magazine for November,” *The Bourbon News*, November 6, 1917)

The question of when Eve left her work at Pine Mountain is harder to figure out. In a letter dated Spring 1916, Marguerite Butler stated that Eve would be away until the end of April. ([Letter from Marguerite Butler, Spring 1916](https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?attachment_id=12143)) By that time, however, Eve was married and living in Lexington, Kentucky, with Alan. She may have continued to serve on the board for some time after that, but her documented engagements all appear to have been in Lexington, such as when she was elected president of the Civil League for the year of 1917. (“Mrs. Gilmour President,” *The Courier-Journal*, December 8, 1916) A few years after that, Eve and Alan had left Kentucky behind for the west coast, settling in southern California, where Eve would remain for some time.

Although perhaps no fixed relationship existed between Eve and Pine Mountain in the years that followed her move to California, the influence of the school was long-lasting. Her career in social work, her devotion to improving the lives of children, her strength and determination--all can be traced back to her time in the Kentucky mountains.
