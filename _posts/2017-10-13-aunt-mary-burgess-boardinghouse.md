Last week, I found myself in Towson, Maryland, with a couple of hours to kill and a family story to pursue.

My great-aunt Mary--my grandfather's oldest sister--was a genealogy enthusiast and, until her death, the resident expert on the Newman family. Years later, I happened across a Newman family tree she made in 1987, annotated in her distinctive handwriting with family stories. One of these stories was about Aunt Maggie Burgess.

Maggie was Jacob Newman's sister and aunt to the Newman aunts. She married William Burgess, a Civil War veteran and railroad agent; they had five daughters and lived in southern Pennsylvania. Later, the then-widowed Maggie moved to Towson, Maryland, with her daughters, where, in the 1920s, they "kept a boardinghouse in a large, porticoed white house with 'grounds,'" according to Aunt Mary. "At 6 or 7 or 8 or thereabouts I went with Uncle Jake and maybe Kate or Bab on occasional trips 'for the day' to the Burgess household/boardinghouse in Towson (when Jake was visiting from Pittsburgh for weekends)."

This story makes me picture a large Victorian house full of Newman (technically, Burgess) women. Maggie, the matriarch, remembered by Aunt Mary as a "very little woman in black with a cane." Maggie's oldest daughter Lula Heffelfinger, who moved to Towson after being widowed, accompanied at times by her daughter Mary and her granddaughter Nancy. Lula's younger sister, Margaret, who was unmarried. And, a favorite of her Newman cousins, the youngest, Nan, a "large, cheerful woman" (Aunt Mary's words again), who had a career as a singer and while traveling, met and married Hobart Smock, a tenor, who also ended up at the boardinghouse.

In fact, I later learned, Hobart Smock was the original owner of the house. According to photos at the Baltimore County Public Library1, he purchased the house in 1908, a few years after his marriage to Nan, and called it "Carolcroft," because of his interest in glee clubs and choirs.

For many reasons, it does not surprise me that, even as he played a critical role in the Burgess boardinghouse, Hobart Smock was only a footnote in Aunt Mary's retelling. Up against the Newman women, even an illustrious tenor would be harmonizing in the background.

Sitting in my rental car in Towson, I fired up Google Maps. Census records told me that the house was located at 205 Aigburth Road, so I set out for that address, looking for large, porticoed houses that might match Aunt Mary's description. I wasn't sure if this quest would bear fruit--house numbers and street names probably have changed since the early 1900s--but fortunately, I also had an old photo I had stumbled across during my research, which although a bit blurry, gave me an image of a house with a gabled roof and two large chimneys.

The GPS announced that I had arrived at my destination, just as I pulled up in front of Towson High School, and as I looked to my right, I saw, half-hidden by trees, a large house with a front porch, looking very similar to the house depicted in the photo I had found.

The railings on the front porch had been updated, and the house was both green and white, but it appeared that the Burgess boardinghouse was still standing, after more than a hundred years.

I didn't linger at the house--just long enough to take a photo and note the location for future reference--yet this short trip has remained with me. The experience of visiting places that were important to my ancestors helps me feel connected to them, in a way that transcends memory.

Locating and visiting historic homes is a ritual that I will always associate with Aunt Mary. My father has photographs taken during his trips with her to find our ancestors' homes in southeastern Pennsylvania, denoted with the addresses and directions. Emboldened by my high school independent study on family history, during my senior year, I assembled these directions into an itinerary, and that summer, on the way home from--of all places--touring Goucher College in Towson, Maryland, my family visited these houses and towns where our ancestors had spent their lives. Though she was not with us, Aunt Mary was our tour guide.

I have a postcard that Aunt Mary sent my brother and me in 1997. In it, she thanks us for sending her a postcard from Gettysburg, where we had just gone on vacation. At the end, she asks, "Did you also see the town where your Dad lived when he was a boy?"

It is not just the stories we tell, but the places where we live out our lives, that should be remembered, and passed on.
