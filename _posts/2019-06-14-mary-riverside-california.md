A couple of months ago, I hopped into a temperamental rental car, drove forty minutes on a terrifyingly large freeway, and arrived in Riverside, California. My partner and I were on vacation in Southern California, a vacation we had planned around a conference she was attending in Anaheim. As soon as we decided that we would be going to the Los Angeles area, I knew that I wanted to plan a research trip to Riverside.

Riverside is the distant town that my great-great-aunt Mary moved to in order to attend [library school]({{site.baseurl}}/mary.2016-12-15-mary-riverside-library-service-school). After obtaining her degree, she worked at the library at the Citrus Experiment Station, located at the University of California at Riverside. I knew very few details about Mary's education and career, and sometimes I wondered how much of the story I had constructed of her life was even true, since there was little to no paper trail to rely on. I decided to visit the archives at the Riverside Public Library and UC Riverside, to see what fragments of Mary's life story I could find there.

I arrived at the Riverside Public Library just as it was opening. It is no longer the [ornate, eye-catching building of Mary's time]({{site.baseurl}}/mary/2016-12-15-mary-riverside-library-service-school), now a plain, tan building with a pagoda on the lawn out front. I made my way down to the local history section, and the local history specialist showed me to a study room, where several carts of boxes waited for me, the [Riverside Library Service School collection](https://www.riversideca.gov/library/history_aids_libraryschool.asp).

Most of the collection consisted of student folders. As I pulled the tops off one box after another, looking for the N's, I wondered whether Mary's student folder still existed--or whether it had even ever existed. That was certainly a possibility. "Mary Newman" was a relatively common name, and I could have taken a wrong path in my research. What if another Mary Newman had attended library school in Riverside? Then I had come all of this way, for no reason.

But then, suddenly, there it was: Mary Newman's folder. I flipped it open, and saw handwriting that looked almost familiar to me. An application form for the Riverside Library Service School, received September 26, 1928, for Mary Ellen Newman, born in Bedington, West Virginia, aged 40.

It was her.

In September of 1928, Mary was living in Hollywood, California, with her sister [Eve]({{site.baseurl}}/eve.md). At age forty, she was about to make a dramatic change in her life. After years of working in industrial and commercial offices, she was about to become a librarian. 

Earlier that year, Mary had done two weeks of practice work at the Washington County Free Library in Hagerstown, Maryland, during which time she went on a couple of trips on their book wagon, which is considered one of, if not the first, American mobile library, or bookmobile. The book wagon was the brainchild of Washington County librarian Mary Titcomb, who wanted her library to serve even the most rural residents in the county and came up with the idea of a book wagon, which would travel around the county bringing books to its residents. The first book wagon was powered by a horse, but by the time my aunt Mary took her turn on it, the wagon had been replaced by a car that had been specially outfitted to store many volumes of books to distribute throughout the county.

Nellie Chrissinger, the assistant librarian at the Washington County Free Library, was in charge of the book wagon, and she was the first to tell Mary about the Riverside Library Service School.

In September of 1928, Mary posted a letter to Charles Woods, the Riverside Public Library librarian and head of the Riverside Library Service School, requesting the requirements for admission to the school, saying, "I am desirous of getting sufficient training to enable me to qualify for a position as business librarian." After meeting with Woods in person, Mary submitted her application. In her application, she shared that, although she had not gone to college, she had attended Patrick's Business College in York, Pennsylvania, and had been privately tutored in mathematics, Latin, German, French, Spanish, literature, and history. She also highlighted her "extensive" travel in the United States: "I have spent weeks or months at different seasons in St. Paul, Minn., Minneapolis, Minn., Baltimore, Md., with an occasional trip to Washington, D.C., Conrad, Montana - also Quebec - and Montreal, Canada. Also several months in 79th Street Neighborhood Settlement House of Henry Street Settlement, New York City, N.Y." This was in addition to international travel, to England, Scotland, Ireland, and Norway, where she was accompanied in the first three countries by a tutor to study history and literature.

Mary also produced references to attest to her experience and character. 

Dorothy Wysor, General Secretary of the Los Angeles Travelers Aid Society, where Mary had worked as her secretary in 1926, and who was a friend of Eve's, described Mary as a "woman of fine personal character and integrity," "a person of intelligence and of bookish interests," and "a conscientious secretary and ... a good manager." She ended with, "If she does not have to learn too many entirely new skills, I believe that you would find her a very adaptable employee." Quite an endorsement.

Alice Tyler, Dean of the School of Library Science at Western Reserve University, wrote a somewhat shorter letter, attesting to Mary's character and aptitude for public service. "I have a high opinion of Miss Newman as a cultured, refined and ambitious woman," she stated.

Mary Titcomb's recommendation was even briefer: "Her work was reported to me as being satisfactory."

Despite the seemingly lackluster recommendations of her former employers, Mary was admitted to the 1929 class of the Riverside Library Service School. During the "long course," which met from December to August of 1929, each student spent five weeks working in each of the library's five departments: cataloging, reference, loan desk, branches (which included work in four special libraries in Riverside), and children's. This practice work was supplemented with lectures and assignments on topics related to the departments in which they served, as well as several traditional courses during the summer. Each student also completed a thesis; Mary, probably influenced by her practice work at the Washington County Free Library, wrote about library services to rural communities, including the very book wagon that she worked on.

Students in the long course were graded on their performance in their course work and on their rotations, and the department heads who supervised the students wrote up reports that included descriptions of not only their performance but their character.

While Mary's instructors might not have been impressed by her attention to detail, they had some surprising--to me--things to say about her character and personality.

"Miss Newman has a good background, meets people well and likes to be helpful," wrote Frances Strong, county library instructor. "Splendid background. Very good in her work with the Public. Has the right idea of Service. Dislikes very much the record work or any transaction requiring detail work. Slow and not very accurate," wrote Bernice Swiezey, from the loan desk. Louise Strong, from the children's department, wrote: "If she could master details she would be an excellent juvenile librarian for she has a splendid background and meets the public well. She does not take responsibility well and requires almost constant supervision." "In her detail work from day to day, she worked so intensely in her desire to learn every detail that she confused herself frequently," wrote Minnie Lewis, from cataloging, adding that "The older ones always find the new detail of cataloging hard, but she would be industrious and useful in such a position. Pleasant and liked by both older and younger associates." And perhaps the most surprising account was from Margaret Reynolds, business library, who was expectedly appreciative of Mary's business experience, but also noted Mary's "marked humor."

Marked humor? Meets people well? Pleasant? These qualities did not match the picture I had of Mary: a stern woman who cried at my great-grandfather's wedding and was, as my great-aunt Barbara had said, "the least lovable" of the aunts. Of all of the information I had expected to find in the archives, a deeper picture of Mary's personality was not one of them. 

I was also realizing that Mary's life after library school was not as carefree as I had originally imagined. Instead of going straight on to work at the Citrus Experiment Station, it took Mary years to find a position in a library. In fact, she finished her degree just months before the stock market crash of October 1929, which plunged the country into the Great Depression. This may have been a reason that she struggled to find work in the subsequent years. She held a number of temporary jobs, including as librarian for the Southern Sierras Power Company and assistant at the Arlington branch of the Riverside Public Library. Her ambition to become a business librarian shifted, and at times, she professed a desire for public or county library work.

Mary did not find her job at the Citrus Experiment Station until 1937, and starting out, the position was part-time. She worked full-time only part of the year, from April 1 to June 30, and she finally became a full-time employee in 1941.

The Citrus Experiment Station (CES) was established in 1907 as a research institution to support California's growing citrus industry. The team of scientists at the station focused their research on agricultural chemistry, plant physiology, plant pathology, entomology, plant breeding, and orchard management. Their work resulted in a number of developments that improved the citrus industry, including optimum conditions for the storage of citrus, investigations into effective herbicides, and the first studies of the effects of air pollution on crops. The CES also acquired the largest citrus collection in the world, consisting of 1,200 species and varieties of trees.

The CES library played an important role in the research conducted by the station, collecting books, periodicals, and reports on horticulture and plant-based sciences. These publications often came from locations around the world, and the library's staff was responsible for hunting them down and making them available to the researchers who needed them. As long-time CES librarian Margaret Buvens described, this task "becomes a game that is at once the despair and joy of every librarian. The pleasure is great when a long-wanted item appears in a dealer's catalog, or perhaps even comes to light in an innocent-looking bundle of 'junk' contributed by some staff member."

Most of the time that Mary worked at the Citrus Experiment Station, the United States was at war. World War II prevented most international publications from reaching the station, as the library's 1941-42 annual report stated: "It has been impossible to obtain many foreign publications, and contacts with some exchange institutions has been lost." Professional association meetings were limited or disbanded during this time as well. Work appears to have gone on at the library, however. Reference services continued and even increased. Multiple students from the Riverside Library Service School did their practice work there. Annual reports detailed volumes that had been purchased, mostly domestically, as well as indexing and bibliography projects completed, including a bibliography on the Oriental Fruit Moth that Mary compiled.

Mary retired from the CES Library in March 1946. She had worked there for just under ten years, and she was 70 years old. On her retirement, she received a scrapbook that was signed by her colleagues at the station, and which now resides in the UC Riverside Archives.

Flipping through this book, the culmination of Mary's library career, I could not help but reflect on how much I had learned about her in only one short day visiting these archives and searching through these collections. Having read her words about her life, her plans, and her hopes for the future, I am most struck by her determination. After working in offices for years, she made a career change, moved across the country, pursued higher education as an older student, faced both sexism and ageism in her job search, overcame health issues, and found a job supporting the research of influential scientists. She may not have been the easiest to work with, perhaps, but she was smart and committed to her work. 

I am also struck by the absence of these stories among those that have been passed down through our family. I never knew as much about Mary as I did about her sisters, and I wonder how this reflects her relationships with her nieces and nephews, and great-nieces and nephews, the ones I relied on for learning these family stories. Mary was, after all, the aunt who never returned from her adventures. Babbie, Eve, Meg, Agnes, Kate: they all found their ways back to Waynesboro eventually--or they never left. Mary left and never came back. Without any connection to those who would tell her story, Mary's life has been slowly slipping away. I will only be able to recreate so much of it, but I am grateful to the records and archives that preserve her story, waiting to be uncovered.

I would like to thank the staffs of the Riverside Public Library and the UC Riverside Archives who helped me to locate and access the archival collections I consulted during this trip.
