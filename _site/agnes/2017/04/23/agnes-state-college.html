				<p>After <a href="/newman-aunts/agnes">Agnes</a> was <a href="/newman-aunts/agnes/2016/09/23/agnes-forestry">refused entry to the Pennsylvania State Forestry Academy</a>, she didn’t give up on her ambitions for higher education. In the fall of 1917, she was one of five “farmerettes” studying agriculture at State College (now Pennsylvania State University). “Five girls with back-to-the-farm hankerings, are studying scientific farming in the two-year agricultural course at the Pennsylvania State College,” the <em>Indiana Gazette</em> reported. Even though the United States was by then at war, the newspaper account claimed that this had “nothing to do whatever in their choice of a profession. They simply wanted to learn how to feed chickens, hoe beans, milk cows and plough. Later they expect to use their knowledge in managing their own farms.” </p>

<p>State College’s two-year course in agriculture was, according to the 1917-18 course catalog, “designed to meet the needs of young men with farm experience who are not prepared to enter the four-year courses in agriculture.” (91) The emphasis on young men was not entirely true; in 1912, the course had been formally opened to women–albeit with modification. Students could take courses in the domestic arts, while also developing knowledge in scientific agriculture, with the ultimate goal of being able to “make a living on the farm.” “Country girls” who graduate “find on their return home that their interests are elsewhere. They have been unfitted rather than fitted for life in the country,” wrote Margaret B. MacDonald in <em>The Penn State Farmer</em>. By allowing women to gain a more well-rounded knowledge of agriculture, “the object of the course is to make successful, resourceful, happy women of farmers’ wives and daughters.” (201)</p>

<p>Both the newspaper account and Penn State’s own publication attributed the goals of the two-year agriculture program and the women who attended it to developing the knowledge and skills to work on farms, often as wives and daughters of farmers. For someone as independent as Agnes, who had at one point aspired to the male-dominated profession of forestry, would this have been her goal?</p>

<p>Agnes’s ultimate goal may in fact have been to further her education beyond the initial two-year program, as she subsequently enrolled in the four-year course in Horticulture at Penn State. This program included courses on plant breeding, floriculture, vegetable gardening, landscape gardening, and entomology, as well as a summer practicum, consisting of “six weeks of survey work in commercial truck gardens, florists’ establishments, nurseries, orchards, greenhouses, and small fruit plantations.” (126) Classes, as described in the course catalog, included recitation and practicum hours, emphasizing the practical application of the studies the students were undertaking.</p>

<p><iframe style="border: 0px;" src="https://books.google.com/books?id=3KRIAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;output=embed" width="500" height="900" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>

<p>Apart from her studies, Agnes appears to have been an active student at State College. She was a member of the Press Club, Crab Apple Club, Current Events Club, and Penn State Grange, and was active in athletics. She played hockey and basketball, received class numerals for her high scoring, and even served as president of the Women’s Athletic Association during her senior year.</p>

<p>One of Agnes’s more amusing activities involved serving on a committee that banned “improper dancing,” such as “cheek-to-cheek” or “toddling,” at house parties and college dances. The committee was “instructed to demonstrate before the Women’s Student Association just what is and what is not acceptable as proper form on the dance floor. This group will meet at the close of the Christmas vacation and their recommendations will be law.”</p>

<p>When Agnes graduated from State College in 1922, she became the first in the Newman family to earn a college degree. As the youngest child, she likely benefitted from changing attitudes about higher education for women. It is somewhat surprising, however, that only a few months after her graduation, Agnes married a farmer, fulfilling Penn State’s goal for her to become a “successful, resourceful, happy” farmer’s wife.</p>

<p>Agnes and her husband, Milton Lightwood, performed agricultural work at her <a href="/newman-aunts/meg/2017/03/21/meg-experimental-services">sister Meg’s settlement house</a> and then started their own, ultimately unsuccessful, fruit farm in Maryland. Agnes’s horticultural education would continue, however, as she later attended the Ambler School of Horticulture for Women, and after her divorce from Milton in the 1940s, she finally embarked on the professional career in horticulture that she had initially prepared for during her time at State College.</p>
