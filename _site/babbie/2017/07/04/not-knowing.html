				<p>I’ve been lingering on a post about Babbie for several weeks now. I’d like to blame my delay on personal and professional travel, on taking on some freelance work, on a huge stack of books next to my bed demanding my attention. But the truth is, I’ve just had a hard time wrapping my head around this next post. I’ve been doing research, jotting down notes, and drafting prose, but it hasn’t been coming together cohesively. Today I realized that there’s a story hidden in that post, and until I tell it and reflect on what it might mean, I won’t be able to truly tell the story of Babbie’s life.</p>

<p>On August 5, 1925, Babbie’s middle son, Richard, committed suicide by taking cyanide. He was 25 years old.</p>

<p><em>The Gettysburg Times</em> reported the details. Richard “died from the effects of poison which was self administered. A note left by the young man explained why he committed the act. Despondency was given as the reason, this being brought on by ill health. The young man had been a sufferer from heart trouble for a number of years.”</p>

<p>The newspaper account relates how Richard had seemed his usual self, had eaten dinner with his parents before going upstairs to bed around 10:00 p.m. Then there is the moment that sticks with me:</p>

<p>“He was not heard moving about the house after this time, but shortly after midnight <strong>his mother</strong> heard him moaning as though in great pain.”</p>

<p>This grisly newspaper article depicts Babbie at a moment in time. It is the moment right before her husband Abner climbs to the attic, to discover his son’s body, with a note next to it. It is the moment right before she is greeted with intense sorrow, pain, and confusion. It is the moment right before she realizes that she has lost her son.</p>

<p>This is not the lone suicide in our family history. Over the course of ten years, the Newman aunts lost three men in their lives to suicide. I’ve already told of how Eve’s husband, Alan Gilmour, committed suicide, only eight months before Edward. There is also the aunts’ brother Jake, my great-great uncle, who committed suicide in 1935, by sitting in a running car inside his garage.</p>

<p>I am drawn to speculate about why these men would commit suicide. <em>The Gettysburg Times</em> refers to longstanding heart problems for Richard. Alan Gilmour’s obituary mentions his health failing a year before his death. According to family stories, Jake was never as successful in business as his older brothers, and he was gay at a time when homosexuality was not accepted. It is easy to seek out these explanations, to accept them as truth, to codify them and make them part of the story that I am telling.</p>

<p>But the only true thing is that I will never know what really happened. I will never be able to understand why they felt such desperation that they wanted to take their own lives. I will never be able to answer the many questions that surround their deaths. So, instead, I ask myself why I am so caught up by this story. Why can’t I just finish my next post about Babbie and continue on with this project?</p>

<p>When I think about these tragic deaths, I think less about the men, but about the women they left behind. After so much loss–so sudden, so unexplainable–how do you move on? How do you rebuild your life after your partner leaves you? How do you recover from the death of a child? How do you feel the absence of a sibling and not experience overwhelming heartache and sorrow every day? And, finally, how do you live with the “not knowing”?</p>

<p>I always like to have an explanation. I want answers, and it’s hard when I can’t find them. My search for answers is what started me on this project, but I won’t be able to answer every question I have. When I think about Richard, Alan, and Jake, I will have to live with the “not knowing,” which echoes down through the generations, from my great-great aunts, down to me.</p>
