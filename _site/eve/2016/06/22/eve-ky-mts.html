				<p>The first story I want to share is an easy choice. It’s the story that kicked off my research into the aunts’ lives, the first story that I was able to transform from a romantic family legend to a real historical account: the story of <a href="/newman-aunts/eve">Eve</a> in the Kentucky mountains.</p>

<p>As Aunt Barbara told the story, Eve left Waynesboro in her early twenties and went down to Kentucky to teach the children of mountaineers. “Was she teaching at a school?” I wondered. “How did she get the idea to go to Kentucky?”</p>

<p>Like most family stories, though, there were frustratingly few concrete details attached to it. Aunt Barbara didn’t know much more about this episode of Eve’s life, and, honestly, she probably didn’t <em>need</em> to know. The story showed that Eve was daring and rebellious and ran off to be of value to people who needed her, and that certainly isn’t a bad image to have. But I couldn’t help but wonder what other stories were hiding behind this one. What was Eve doing in Kentucky? How did she end up there? And, in doing this, was she really being as daring and rebellious as we all thought?</p>

<p>I began my search by trying to figure out what schools in Kentucky might have attracted young women from northern states, and that’s when I discovered the settlement school movement.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ket.org/settlement/setschools_01.html">Wrote Harry Hinkle for KET</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They began almost a century ago, born of a convergence of influences including national social reform, growing ranks of idealistic young college-educated women who wanted to teach others, civic-minded women’s organizations, and an expressed desire from mountain people for an education for their children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This description fit perfectly my picture of Eve: she was educated, progressive, and idealistic. Here was an opportunity to educate the children of “mountain people,” and she was going to take it.</p>

<p>The Appalachian settlement schools were an offshoot of the urban settlement movement that originally started in London in the late 1800s and then made its way across the Atlantic, where Jane Addams’s Hull House in Chicago and Lillian Wald’s Henry Street in New York City were the most prominent American settlement houses that offered education, health care, and other services to the community. The first rural settlement school in Appalachia was the Hindman Settlement School, founded in 1902, but it was followed by many others throughout Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina.</p>

<p>The goal of the settlement schools, writes Jess Stoddart in her book <em>Challenge and Change in Appalachia</em>, was “to educate the children back to their homes instead of away from them.” (p. 56-57) Growing out of the Progressive movement, which emphasized the importance of education and new skills in the industrial age, the settlement schools tried to prepare the Appalachian children for life in modern society, yet encourage them to maintain their cultural traditions. The schools emphasized character development and vocational skills, in addition to academic subjects, and the (mainly) women who operated the schools encouraged the appreciation and preservation of Appalachian culture, including textile work, arts and crafts, and folk songs.</p>

<p>The women who staffed settlement schools were often known to the locals as “fotched-on” women because most had been <em>fetched</em> down from the Northeast. The women were also highly educated, with as many as ninety percent of female settlement workers having college degrees and half having undertaken graduate work. This was because the settlement movement, Stoddart explains, was a “socially acceptable outlet for these young women graduates that allowed them to use their talents and energy.” (p. 10) Women who were inspired by the values of the Progressive Era, who wanted to use their college educations in an “acceptable” manner, made the often arduous trip down to the mountains of Appalachia to work as teachers, secretaries, and house mothers at settlement schools.</p>

<p>So was Eve, as the story suggests, one of these “fotched-on” women?</p>

<p>A Google search later, and there she was.</p>

<p><img src="/newman-aunts/assets/images/eve-ky-mts.png" alt="Description of a talk by Eve Newman at the University of Wisconsin library school." /></p>

<p><em>Wisconsin Library Bulletin, Volumes 8-9. 1912.</em></p>

<p>In the fall of 1912, Eve was at the University of Wisconsin, delivering a lecture about her “work with the mountain whites” in Hindman, Kentucky. Yet more records of Eve’s travels on behalf of Hindman appeared: in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=f6nhAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA54&amp;dq=newman+hindman+battle+creek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqiqOW9bTNAhVE1R4KHThPDAQQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=newman%20hindman%20battle%20creek&amp;f=false">Michigan</a>, in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Cdw_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=%22miss+newman%22+hindman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi90va89LTNAhXLGh4KHSRgAUMQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22miss%20newman%22%20hindman&amp;f=false">Boston</a>, in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z9GAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=eve%20newman%20hindman&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q=eve%20newman%20hindman&amp;f=false">New York</a>. These records suggest that she was indeed working at the Hindman Settlement School, the first rural settlement school in the United States, but not as a teacher–as we had previously thought. From at least 1912 to 1913, Eve was the school’s secretary, a position that held responsibility for more than just drafting letters and filing papers. As a still young school that relied on the outside world for survival, Hindman needed to actively generate support and raise funds, and Eve, often accompanied by one of the school’s co-founders, traveled across the country, promoting and fundraising for the school.</p>

<p>One of her many addresses took place on April 16, 1913, when Eve spoke about Hindman at the 22nd Continental Congress of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Her address, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=E2MUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22miss%20newman%22%20hindman&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=%22miss%20newman%22%20hindman&amp;f=false">which was preserved in the Congress proceedings</a>, explains, in her own words, the value of the school to the local community.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eighteen years ago Miss [Katherine] Pettit and Miss [May] Stone, who founded our school, first went to Hazard, in Perry County. They were not interested in the mountain people especially. The papers of that time were filled with the news of feuds, and they wanted to see the people of the mountains and teach them a better way, as they spoke of it, of settling their differences. They had done settlement work and so they turned their party into a party of settlement workers, and they established cooking classes and sewing classes and kindergartens and Sunday schools.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>About six years after this, these same people went into the mountains with these same classes. In the meantime they decided that they must have an industrial school for that region of the mountains. When people in other parts of the mountain country found out that schools had been established these young women received letters from nearly every mountain county, begging them to bring their schools there. It was while they were at Hazard that an old man came to them and tried to get them to come to his county. He walked from Hindman, a distance of twenty miles. He wore white homespun trousers and a red homespun hunting jacket cut after the pattern of his grandfather of the Revolutionary War. He had never worn a hat or a pair of shoes, and he told them he could open a chestnut bur with his bare heel. He said: “I have heard about the work you women are doing here in Perry County, and I came over to ask you to come over to our county. When I was a little boy I used to hoe corn. When I would get to the end of the row and look up and down Troublesome Creek, I would wonder if anybody would ever come in and learn us anything. I have growed up without knowing nothing. I have a son and a grandson in the State Prison for murder. But I have grown children over in the Troublesome Creek who are law-abiding citizens, and I want you to come over and tell them how to live.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eve went on to explain how co-founders Katherine Pettit and May Stone moved their school to Hindman, Kentucky, where it had remained for ten years, thanks in part to money raised by the people of the county themselves, and despite terrible odds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Miss Pettit and Miss Stone are two of the bravest women I have ever known. The school has burned three times. The last time it burned the citizens of the county raised $6,000 and bought us a farm. From a small beginning, we have grown to sixty acres and about twelve buildings. We have ninety-five boys and girls who live in the home with us and about 165 day students. All of the work of the school is done by the children. It costs $100 a year to keep a boy or a girl in our school. I am very glad to say that there are great number of the D.A.R. who send us scholarships. The children must work to pay for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eve then described life at Hindman for the students, who went to school every day and learned practical skills, such as home-making, furniture making, and farming. Yet there were many children who remained on the wait list to attend the school, and Eve appealed to the audience for donations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The settlement at Hindman needs scholarships. It also needs a settlement house. I have come directly from Hindman. It took me three days to get over the road … to tell you we want a settlement house and we want the Daughters of the American Revolution to help us. What better monument would there be to them than to have a building on our school ground that was named for them, that would help the sons and daughters we have in our schools who have all their lives been denied the advantages of culture and education that you all have had.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reading this speech, I get a better sense of who Eve was and why she had taken on this work. She speaks passionately about the Hindman School and vividly depicts the Appalachian people as desirous of an education and worthy of the gifts of others. And, more importantly, she knows how to frame her message to appeal to her audience. Her anecdotes are designed to evoke sympathy on the part of the female listeners, highlighting the eagerness of the children to be educated and the resilience of the school, which had endured three destructive fires. Eve also appeals to the audience’s own interests, suggesting that donating funds for a building at Hindman could be a “monument” to the Daughters of the American Revolution.</p>

<p>The story of Eve in the Kentucky mountains does not end with Hindman, however. While doing my research, I came across the text of “A Soul in the Mountains,” the life story of Reverend Lewis Lyttle, from 1917. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to mention the organization of Pine Mountain School in Harlan. Miss Petitt said, twenty years ago, she would someday organize a school in sight of Pine Mountain. She wrote me to help her locate a place. In May 1912 she came to my house with Miss Butler, their nurse, from Hindman. I, as their guide, went with them and showed them the best places, in my judgment, to build. They selected one of the locations I suggested, and later Miss Petitt, Miss Ethel DeLong, and Miss Eve Newman went North and got people interested in the work, and they have the foundation of a great school laid, which will someday be a great blessing to the mountains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I now knew that Eve worked for a second settlement school in Kentucky–the Pine Mountain Settlement School, founded by Hindman co-founder Katherine Pettit–and that she may have even had a hand in its beginning! In Part 2, I’ll share my findings about Eve’s connection to Pine Mountain: more travels, some old letters, and even a romance.</p>
