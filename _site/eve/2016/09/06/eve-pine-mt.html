				<p>When last we left <a href="/newman-aunts/eve">Eve</a>, she was 25, living in rural Hindman, Kentucky, and <a href="/newman-aunts/eve/2016/06/22/eve-ky-mts">working as a secretary for the Hindman Settlement School</a>, traveling around the country to gather support–and funds–for the school. Hindman had been founded at the turn of the 20th century by two women–May Stone and <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=424">Katherine Pettit</a>–who had first been enlisted by the Women’s Christian Temperance Union to organize summer camps for settlement work in the Kentucky mountains. They stayed on, starting a permanent settlement school, which, after a decade, had built an industrial education program, an agricultural experiment station, a farm and dairy, and a hospital.</p>

<p>But around 1911, Pettit was ready to move on. When she had first started her settlement work in Kentucky, she had visited Pine Mountain, an area of Kentucky that was even more isolated than Hindman and not yet accessible by the railroad. This was an area with a definite need for education, health care, and community outreach, and there was strong local support for a settlement school. Pettit began to scout locations for her school and recruited Hindman’s principal, <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=1696">Ethel De Long</a>, to join her. But before Pettit would leave Hindman, she wanted to secure that school’s future by raising an endowment of $100,000, and Aunt Eve had a large part to play in this effort.</p>

<p>In 1911, Campbell Bascom Slemp, a Republican congressman from Virginia, wrote a <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?attachment_id=28467">letter</a> to Katherine Pettit, describing a visit he had just had from Eve:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About a week ago a young lady blew into my office stating that she represented your institution at Hindman and seemed to be on the search for Mr. Mayo and also any other individuals who might be interested in her cause. It happened to be at the time that I was going to New York to see Mr. Mayo, and some other gentlemen on some very important business matters, and I suggested that Miss Newman go along with me to see Mr. Mayo and also Mrs. Mayo, who was in New York with her husband.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Congressman Slemp picked up the story in New York, where he and Eve met with various wealthy donors, convincing them to donate money to the school. They “stayed right on the ‘job’ to use a term that Miss Newman tells me you like to use,” wrote Slemp, and finally, he shared, “Miss Newman secured for the endowment feature of your school $25,000 in preferred stock of the Elkhorn Fuel Co.” This gift would yield a net annual income of $1250 to the Hindman School. Slemp also wrote that he secured letters of introduction for Eve and himself to Andrew Carnegie and Mrs. Russell Sage.</p>

<p>Slemp closed his letter by sharing his reasons for being invested in these efforts, the third being:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the very pleasing and charming personality of your representative. Her devotion to the interest of the Hindman school[,] her naturally unaffected disposition as well as her personal attractions appealed to all of us very strongly and I really think this was one of the contributory causes of the enthusiasm all of us had while in New York. I mention all these things because I thought you would like to know all of the details connected with this last work and our mental impressions as we went along.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This letter provides a fascinating description of the mechanics behind fundraising in the early 1900s–traveling from city to city, enlisting the support of persons in power, obtaining letters of introduction, and arranging meetings. Persistence and enthusiasm were weighed against an established social order, which required deliberate orchestrations and the cultivation of relationships.</p>

<p>I also love this letter for what it tells us about Eve. From the very opening of the letter, when Eve “blows in” to Congressman Slemp’s office, we are presented with a woman who is dedicated to her cause and will not take “no” for an answer. At the end of his letter, Slemp praises her “devotion,” her “unaffected disposition,” even her “personal attractions” (!), attributing much of their fundraising success to Eve herself. Though this account is hardly, it seems, impartial, it establishes an idea of Eve as a determined young woman, which we can explore further while surveying her time at the Pine Mountain Settlement School.</p>

<p>While fundraising efforts for both Hindman and Pine Mountain continued, Pettit and De Long were making arrangements for the site of their new school, on land donated by William Creech, a farmer, large landowner, and community leader, who greatly wanted a school on Pine Mountain. After some negotiations between Creech and the Kentweva Coal and Lumber Company, the two women finally had their land: over two hundred acres on the north slope of Pine Mountain, where two creeks joined to form Greasy Creek.</p>

<p>The Pine Mountain Settlement School officially opened in the spring of 1913, with a borrowed house, a Masonic Lodge building, some tents–and big plans. Over the next few months, the small, determined group of women prepared their land for farming, ordered and transported a sawmill over the mountain, built foot logs over the creek, fenced in their land against wandering neighborhood hogs, petitioned the local Fiscal Court for the building of a road over the mountain, organized Saturday afternoon clubs and Sunday Schools for the nearby children, and put on a Fourth of July celebration.</p>

<p><em>Wagons arriving at Pine Mountain, May 12, 1913. “hook_album_2blk__019,” Mary Rockwell Hook Album II, Photographs, Pine Mountain Settlement School, Pine Mountain, KY. 2016 Sept. 6.</em></p>

<p>They also planned for the expansion of the school, soliciting help from agricultural and engineering experts, who gave them advice on land use, buildings, and septic systems. Mary Rockwell Hook, a Kansas City architect, also volunteered her services. On her first visit to Pine Mountain, she later recalled in a <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=12743">1920 speech</a>, “We three tramped over their acres, studying the different streams for water supply, levels and sites for buildings and gradually laying out a comprehensive plan for the complete development of a school of industry for 150 children.” Hook’s eventual <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=12710">Land Use Plan</a> succinctly stated how the school’s layout reflected the values of the school: “The founders of Pine Mountain knew that the physical characteristics of the land and the building expressed the spiritual ideals of the school. Therefore they wanted to keep the native character of the landscape setting and took, through the course of years, unimaginable pains to preserve each detail that contributed to the picture of a characteristic mountain valley.”</p>

<p>Although Eve was not part of the original “family” who moved in to the school in the spring of 1913, by 1914, she was established at Pine Mountain and serving as the <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=17947">office and field secretary</a>. Eve continued to travel on lecturing tours to raise money and support for the school. Catherine Rittenhouse, a summer worker in 1914, <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=1729">mentions one such trip</a>, a two-week trip in July 1914, on which Eve and Ethel De Long hoped to raise $7,500.</p>

<p>Pine Mountain was located in a rural, mountainous area of Kentucky, accessible only by foot or mule. For Eve, who had to travel often, this must have been difficult, as illustrated by a <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?attachment_id=4889">letter</a> written by Ethel De Long, in which she provides detailed instructions about how their new housekeeper could get to Pine Mountain from New York, a journey that took the better part of two days, and involved taking three trains, followed by a six-mile trek on foot or horseback: “The easiest way of coming is by the Southern Express to Bristol, Tennssee [sic], which leaves New York about nine-thirty P. M. … She will reach Bristol the next after noon where she must buy another ticket for Pineville, Kentucky. … Reaching Pineville about eleven o’clock that night she can stay at the Pineville Hotel or the Continental … Her train for Dillon leaves the next morning at seven-thirty-three. At one stop, Harlan, she has forty minutes to get off the train while it goes about private business of its own, and she can get a certain sort of lunch at the Busy-Bee Restaurant. From Dillon the remaining six miles is either on horseback or afoot … She ought to reach the school by half past two.”</p>

<p>In addition to her duties as secretary, Eve was very much a part of the “family” at Pine Mountain, responsible for caring for the children and assisting with activities and events at the school. She lived in “Old Log,” a renovated log cabin dating from the early 1800s, with Ethel De Long and the young boys who boarded at the school.</p>

<p><img src="/newman-aunts/assets/images/log.jpg" alt="Old Log" /></p>

<p><em>Old Log. “II_5_old_log_office_201.jpg,”Old Log,” Series 10: Built Environment, Pine Mountain Settlement School, Pine Mountain, KY. 2016 Sept. 5.</em></p>

<p>Around June of 1914, they moved into the newly renovated house, and Ethel described the experience in a letter to her mother: “The house, you know, is the old-fashioned two pens and a passage—with wide front porch. … I must tell you more of this household. Me—the oldest and most responsible, Chester, aged 12 and his fascinating little brother aged 6…; Miss Newman in the other room and little Monroe, aged 9, with her.” (Letter from Ethel DeLong to her mother, June 5, 1914)</p>

<p><img src="/newman-aunts/assets/images/monroe.jpg" alt="Monroe" /></p>

<p><em>Monroe (right), Eve’s roommate in Old Log in 1915. “roe_025a-1024x1007,” Philip Roettinger Album - Part I, Photographs, Pine Mountain Settlement School, Pine Mountain, KY. 2016 Sept. 6.</em></p>

<p>A November 1914 <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=16345">letter</a> to the Friends of Pine Mountain described Old Log, as it was when Eve lived there: “With its wide porch, fireplace, and charming low-ceiled rooms, it preserves the cheerful homeliness of pioneer days. … True to the spirit of the old days it is a hospitable house … In the morning it hums with sounds, while untrained little hands are learning how to make its beds ‘pretty’ and keep its floors clean. At night you hear astonishing things, as teeth are washed and feet are scrubbed for bed. ‘I aim to stay with ye till you run me off. You don’t reckon you’ll run me off till I’m twenty, do ye?’”</p>

<p><em>Foot log over Greasy Creek. “pmss3182,” XII Helen de Long Photograph Album, Photographs, Pine Mountain Settlement School, Pine Mountain, KY. 2016 Sept. 5.</em></p>

<p>In addition to their work at the school, Eve and the other settlement workers often traveled into the local community. In September 1914, teacher Marguerite Butler <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=11320">wrote</a> that she was staying in the log cabin “taking care of Miss Newman’s boys for she has gone off in the mountains to spend the night.” That fall Eve, Marguerite, and summer worker Ethel McCullough also took a five-mile walk down Greasy Creek to a religious meeting. Because of the rain, the creeks were high, so they had what Marguerite <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=11320">described</a> as “many exciting experiences trying to cross.”</p>

<p>Marguerite also <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=11320">described</a> a trip on mules that she took with Eve and teacher Margaret Watts. “It was a glorious and a glorious country through which we went. Honestly, our trail beat the Grand Canyon one in places in roughness. Three times the trail simply ended, but spying it again in the distance we took courage to go on. In the whole day we met about five people and only passed about four houses. You never saw such a wilderness.”</p>

<p><img src="/newman-aunts/assets/images/horses.jpg" alt="Riders on horseback" /></p>

<p><em>“cale_1914_004_img,” 1914 Calendar, Series 24: PMSS Publications (Published by the School), Pine Mountain Settlement School, Pine Mountain, KY. 2016 Sept. 6.</em></p>

<p>On October 21, 1914, Eve left with Katherine Pettit and Ethel De Long on a twenty-mile walking trip down Greasy Creek. Marguerite <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=11320">wrote</a> that “they were pictures in their khaki skirts and middies, with their clothes slung over their back in some fetching pack.”</p>

<p>Despite the spare and often difficult living conditions, the young women who worked at Pine Mountain became friends and formed a family at the school. Catherine Rittenhouse <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=1729">related</a> having tea and talking with Eve about how people live in the mountains. “E. said, humorously, that living at home is not one half as complicated as here, for there, when you want anything, all you have to do is to ring a bell.” In September 1914, Eve joined Marguerite and architect Mary Rockwell in a tent to make room for the school’s guests. “Last night Miss Newman stayed with us too,” <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=11320">wrote</a> Marguerite, “so she and I spent the night in one single bed which was on the very edge of the tent floor over quite a little precipice. Once she nearly went out of bed and you ought to have heard the scream.”</p>

<p><img src="/newman-aunts/assets/images/workers.jpg" alt="Marguerite Butler and two other workers" />
<em>Marguerite Butler (left) and two other workers. “X_100_workers_2537_mod-788x1024,” Workers at Pine Mountain Settlement School - II, Photographs - BX100, PIne Mountain Settlement School, Pine Mountain, KY. 2016 Sept. 6.</em></p>

<p>Marguerite also <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?attachment_id=13795">described</a> a night when everyone gathered at Ethel and Eve’s log house for stories, singing, and playing games. “After the little boys went to bed Miss De Long, Miss Newman, Peg, Ethel [McCullough], the two new workers and I sat around talking and feasting on cider, just made that day, nuts, raisins and cakes. We talked about plans for the school, what we would [sic] next year and all until it got very exciting.” <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=11320">Another night</a>, Marguerite, housekeeper Ruth Gaines, teacher Margaret Rothery, Peggy, and Eve “had a grand supper cooking the steak [sent by Marguerite’s father] before the living room fire. We couldn’t bear the thought of frying it so broiled on a home-made arrangement right on top of the hot coals.”</p>

<p>These stories depict both the hard work and excitement that filled the early days of the Pine Mountain Settlement School. The women who journeyed over the mountain to join in the work of the school were devoted to their cause and courageous in their efforts to make a difference in the lives of the “mountain people.” Knowing that Eve was a part of the Pine Mountain community makes me wonder how this experience affected the choices that she made later on in her life; her decision to become a social worker, to work with children, must have been motivated in part by her time at Hindman and Pine Mountain.</p>

<p>Eve’s story at the Pine Mountain Settlement School is not finished, however. The school was responsible for setting her on her next adventure, which I’ll share in my next post about Eve in the Kentucky mountains.</p>

<p>Note: My research into the Pine Mountain Settlement School would not have been possible without the <a href="https://pinemountainsettlement.net/">Pine Mountain Settlement School Collections</a>, a project that is digitizing and making publicly available the school’s archives, from 1913 to the present day. I hope someday to visit the archives in person, but in the meantime, I am grateful to the hard work of all involved in this project.</p>
