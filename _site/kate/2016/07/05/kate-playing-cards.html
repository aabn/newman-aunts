				<p>Of all the Newman aunts, <a href="/newman-aunts/kate">Kate</a> is the one for whom I am most reliant on stories told by my family. Known as a gentle spirit, Kate lived most of her life in Waynesboro and didn’t marry or pursue a career, although she was active in local women’s clubs, an avid collector, and beloved by her family circle. Altogether this amounts to a very full life–but not one that is well-documented in newspapers or books. In our family stories, however, Kate is a memorable figure–the “most lovable” aunt. In fact, I discovered recently, Kate is responsible for some of my best childhood memories of my grandfather, which center on a simple card game: casino.</p>

<p>One summer, as a reprieve from the parks and recreation department-sponsored day camp, my brother and I spent one day a week with my grandfather. Like most (or, some would say, all) Newmans, we appreciate routine, so each day would unfold according to a regimented schedule: Arrive early in the morning. Head down to the swimming pool for a morning swim. Return, change clothes, and prepare lunch: tuna fish sandwiches (with celery if I was feeling charitable, without if I was in an inflexible mood) and potato chips, followed by ice cream (microwaved first to make it soft). Then, after lunch, it was time for the games: the board game Parcheesi, then casino.</p>

<p>Casino is a simple card game: the goal is to claim cards from a layout of face-up cards in the middle of the table, by matching cards with the same value from your hand. The game starts with each player being dealt four cards, and with four cards being placed face up in the middle of the table. (To this day, my brother is known for his “unique” dealing style, which involved me crawling under the table to find the cards he “dealt” to me.)</p>

<p>After the cards are dealt, each player plays one card from his/her hand, either matching it with a card from the table, or placing it face-up on the table. A player can also take multiple cards if he/she has a card that represents the sum of those cards’ values. For example, if I hold a six, I could take both a two and a four from the table.</p>

<p>The only complicated part of casino is a play called building, which involved constructing builds of cards to be picked up at a later turn, but I don’t remember using that very much. Our attention was much more focused on the prizes of the game: Big Casino and Little Casino, the ten of diamonds and the two of spades, worth two and one points respectively. These cards make up three of the eleven possible points to be won in each round. Players can win points for the most cards, the most spades, and each ace in their hand. When we played, we also awarded one point per sweep–or when a player takes all the cards from the table. The jubilation on getting a sweep was only exceeded when achieving a sweep <em>while</em> scooping up Big Casino.</p>

<p>Our casino games were always competitive. When my grandfather was first teaching us how to play, we played with our cards face-up, so that he could help us by pointing out where the best move was. As we quickly became more proficient, we each took responsibility for our own hands–and played to win.</p>

<p>In the years following that first summer, casino was a part of all of our get-togethers with our grandfather. And, in a way, Aunt Kate was also a part of these gatherings, since she was the one who taught my grandfather, along with her other nieces and nephews, how to play casino.</p>

<p>Of all the card games to pass down to future generations, why this one? To answer this question, I consulted an article by playing card historian Franco Pratesi called <a href="http://www.naibi.net/A/57-CASINO%20-Z.pdf">“Casino from Nowhere to Vaguely Everywhere,”</a> published in the July/August 1995 issue of <em>The Playing-Card</em>. According to tradition, casino has origin in Italy, although, writes Pratesi:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This use of the word ‘casino’ as the name of a specific card game has left no traces in Italy, neither in old handbooks of games, nor in dictionaries. A possible explanation is that a game, which was commonly played in Italy (probably without written descriptions or known under a different name), was first introduced in England and later modified in America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Casino first arrived in the United States in the late 1800s, but it eventually fell out of favor with the arrival of gin rummy. Based on these dates, Kate would have started playing casino within the first few decades of its diffusion throughout the U.S. and continued to play it long after it had ceased to be popular.</p>

<p>The card game itself had a particularly interesting appeal. In 1944, A.H. Morehead wrote in <em>Modern Hoyle</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the average home Casino is known as a children’s game, but among gamblers it is known as the finest two-handed game of skill, and it is often played for high stakes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This combination of simple rules and potential for strategic game play probably points to why the game has been popular in my family for generations, and why Aunt Kate taught it to the nieces and nephews who sought her company, including my grandfather.</p>

<p>Perhaps my grandfather’s choice of casino for our summer entertainment was purely motivated by the number of players or practice required. I like to think, though, that he wanted to share the game his aunt had taught him with us because of what it represented about our family, and about Aunt Kate.</p>
