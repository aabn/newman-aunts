				<p>In 1908, Joseph F. Daniels, librarian at the State Agricultural College Library in Fort Collins, Colorado, wrote an <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AKlJAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=people%3A%20a%20modern%20emphasis%20in%20library%20training&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">article</a> for the <em>Library Journal</em>. In it, he set out his vision for the training of librarians, stating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is charged that an important aspect of training receives little attention, because the schools begin and end their courses of instruction with the book and its house (the “bookery,” as Mr. Hopkins calls it). And, while we cannot deny that books are fundamental in the idea of a library, we know that People are fundamental in the idea of service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daniels criticized traditional library schools for what he saw as an overemphasis on theory, to the neglect of preparation for library work as a service to people. Library school students were trained to be “book servants,” receiving “technical training and efficiency,” which he deemed less important than “the development of the man or the woman who is to deal with the library and its People” (175-176).</p>

<p>Three years later, Daniels would put his philosophy toward library science education into action, starting a training school for librarians at the <a href="https://www.riversideca.gov/library/about_history.asp">Riverside Public Library</a>: the <a href="https://riversideca.gov/library/history_aids_libraryschool.asp">Riverside Library Service School</a>, its name reflecting its commitment to training librarians for service to the people.</p>

<p>It was at this unorthodox–often controversial–library school that Mary Ellen Newman received her training as a librarian.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>As a newly minted librarian myself, I have a particular connection to Mary’s story. Three years ago, I was thinking seriously about a career change and settled upon librarianship. That decision was one that has changed my life and leads me to wonder why Mary made the same choice.</p>

<p>It appears at least that she had an early interest in books–one of the main reasons that drew (and continues to draw) people to the library profession. In 1954, she wrote a <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/25694134?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">letter</a> to the <em>American Library Association Bulletin</em>. “Long, long ago before we even had a public library in my home town of Waynesboro, Pennsylvania,” she wrote, “I belonged to a group of persons who met every fortnight to read and discuss books of great writers, devoting a winter to one author. Out of this developed ‘the Fortnightly Club’ which is still functioning in that town” (7).</p>

<p>Mary’s membership in the Fortnightly Club hints at a connection to books and reading that may have led her into librarianship, but it does not explain why, by 1930, she had moved across the country to Riverside, California, where she received her degree in library work from the Riverside Library Service School.</p>

<p>Mary’s decision to move to the west coast is even more puzzling because at the time, most of the prominent library schools were on the east coast. In fact, Joseph Daniels founded the Riverside Library Service School in part to provide another opportunity for west coasters to get library training without having to move to the east coast. “It has annoyed me a long time to see our young people go east for training when it seemed unnecessary and expensive,” he explained in a letter to California State Librarian James Gillis. “They may get something good for them in and out of school in the east, but I am afraid that they get some things that are not always good for library progress” (qtd. in Hansen 977).</p>

<p>While Mary’s east coast roots did not make her a likely Riverside student, in another respect, she was exactly the student that Daniels had envisioned when the school opened its doors in 1912. The first course offered at Riverside was a “short course,” aimed at those already working in libraries and/or those who had no formal education. Mary, though she had completed high school, had never gone to college, which was a requirement of many library schools at that time.</p>

<p>Daniels did not want to discriminate against those students without formal higher education, for practical reasons. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3LQUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=what+i+believe+about+library+schools+daniels&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifp-LL5qvQAhXL64MKHXjKBYcQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20i%20believe%20about%20library%20schools%20daniels&amp;f=false">He wrote in <em>Public Libraries</em> in 1913</a> that the opportunities were far different for prospective librarians without formal education. “I believe that there should be a chance for any physically fit candidate, without age limit or ‘educational’ test who desires a chance,” he wrote, but only those with at least two years of college could expect to make a larger income. Because there were more libraries that paid “little reward,” he went on, “it is quite necessary in order to help all, that schooling be offered to the lesser librarians and to those of little reward” (19). The Riverside Library Service School’s commitment to providing educational opportunities to all candidates for library work set it apart from many other library schools at that time.</p>

<p>Daniels’s school was also renowned–or perhaps notorious–for his unorthodox approach to library school curriculum. Namely, that there was none. In his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3LQUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=what+i+believe+about+library+schools+daniels&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifp-LL5qvQAhXL64MKHXjKBYcQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20i%20believe%20about%20library%20schools%20daniels&amp;f=false">1913 <em>Public Libraries</em> article</a>, he outlined eleven points on “What I believe about library schools,” starting with “A library school should be conducted in a library, or adjacent to a library where people are served every day. People are the real consideration in a library.” He proposed dividing students into groups and having them rotate through each department in the library, preparing weekly reports “of all work and study, by station and by hours and by subject matter.” There would be “no assigned reading whatever: Let them listen at lectures or hunt for it,” and lectures should be given “only when needed and then by notable experts who have something more than knowledge of subject matter” (18-19).</p>

<p>It appears that many of these ideas were put into practice at the Riverside Library Service School–to the consternation of many. Daniels’s approach to library education was criticized by many of his peers. One of the main sources of criticism was the Williamson Reports, reports evaluating library schools researched and written by Charles C. Williamson for the Carnegie Corporation.2</p>

<p>Williamson did not think much of the Riverside Library Service School. “Of the school itself there was little tangible evidence,” he wrote. “What I saw going on was not much more than apprentice, or a ‘learn by doing’ method, but yet I left Riverside feeling that a year spent in that environment, no matter what the character of the formal instruction, would be excellent preparation for service in small town and rural libraries” (212). He rejected the idea that a public library could provide professional education for librarians and advised that the school at Riverside close and “all the library interests of the state” be focused on other schools in Los Angeles and Berkeley (212).</p>

<p>Despite these opinions on the quality of its program, the Riverside Library Service School would graduate over 1,000 students over the course of its 30 years’ existence, until it was indefinitely “suspended” in 1943 because of World War II. The school would never receive its accreditation, or official recognition as a library science degree program, from the American Library Association, the professional organization of American librarians.</p>

<p>This didn’t hurt Mary’s chances at a library career, however. She went on from library school to work at the University of California at Riverside’s Citrus Experiment Station for thirty years. In this capacity, she contradicted both Daniels’s prediction of the career possibilities for “lesser librarians” and Williamson’s assessment that the Riverside Library Service School only prepared students for service in “small town and rural libraries.”</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>In many ways, Mary’s library science education, as so enthusiastically designed and espoused by Joseph Daniels, is the education that I didn’t find in library school itself, but the education that I think should be taught in library schools today. Over the two years I spent obtaining my degree, the people I learned the most from were not necessarily my professors, but my supervisors and colleagues who actively worked in libraries and were experts in their fields. My knowledge of the field came from reading blog posts, journal articles, and Twitter–readings I “hunted out,” rather than course lectures. And what truly prepared me to be a librarian was the immersive, hands-on experience of working in libraries and cultural heritage institutions–the practical training dismissed by Williamson as the “‘learn by doing’ method.”</p>

<p>Librarianship has changed dramatically in the decades since Mary attended library school, but the ideas and values that formed the foundation of the Riverside Library Service School are still relevant in library science education today–a commitment to service and a focus on the community of people who come to libraries every day. Daniels’s call for a shift from training in “bookery” to training in service strongly echoes current re-imaginings of libraries from storage units for books to spaces for learning and community building. Seeing these connections across time imbues in my own career a sense of continuity and history and ties me ever more closely to Mary.</p>

<p>1 Todd Dorsett’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Ynx6jIfuU2YC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;ots=M_0qvRfLGW&amp;dq=fortnightly%20club%20waynesboro%20pennsylvania&amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage&amp;q=fortnightly%20club&amp;f=false"><em>Waynesboro As We Knew It</em></a> describes the founding of the “Fortnightly Club,” attributing more than just reading to its activities. “A small group of local young ladies calling themselves the ‘Brownies’ took jaunts into the countryside, and camped at Mont Alto and the present Renfrew Museum and Park, which they christened ‘Camp Willow.’ They studied nature, wrote essays, and held entertainments” (145). One of the original “Brownies” was Mary R. Frantz, who was Mary’s first cousin, once removed. (Mary Frantz was Mary’s mother Emma Frantz’s first cousin–Mary Frantz’s father Benjamin Frantz and Emma’s father Samuel Frantz were brothers. Mary Frantz and Mary Newman were the same age, despite being in different generations.)</p>

<p>2 In 1919, the Carnegie Corporation enlisted Dr. Charles C. Williamson, Head of the Division of Economics and Sociology at the New York Public Library, to evaluate American library schools. As described in the foreword to the report, “all of the library schools in the United States were visited and carefully examined; the most expert opinions on the problem were analyzed and compared; and, finally, the use made of the product of these schools, together with the need and demand for more and better training, was subjected to as thorough a statistical study as the available material permitted” (v).</p>
