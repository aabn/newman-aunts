Agnes Snyder Newman studied Horticulture at Pennsylvania State University. In 1922, she married Milton Hawk Lichtenwallner (Lightwood). They had three children: Alice, Milton Jr., and Samuel. The Lightwoods operated an unsuccessful fruit farm in Maryland for a few years, then moved to Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where Milton worked first as the supervisor of community gardens, then for the Works Progress Administration and the city of Reading. Milton and Agnes divorced in the 1940s, and Agnes went on to pursue her career in horticulture, serving as the director of the public gardens in Wheeling, West Virginia, and of the Los Angeles County Arboretum. She also started a horticultural therapy program at the Friends Hospital in Philadelphia. Upon her retirement, she returned to Waynesboro and remarried, to Wilfred LeCronÂ Harbaugh.
