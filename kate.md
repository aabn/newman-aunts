Birth: October 20, 1885, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania

Death: January 30, 1968

Theresa Katherine "Kate" Newman lived most of her life in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, renting a second-floor, downtown apartment on West Main Street. She also owned a cottage on the Potomac River, which had an outhouse and no electricity. She kept a rowboat there and would go fishing in the river. Although Kate worked a few odd jobs in her early adulthood, she did not have a career as did most of her sisters, but she was a great collector and attended many local auctions. She was also deemed the "most lovable" of the aunts.
