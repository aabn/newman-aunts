Mary Ellen Newman has the distinction, according to family stories, of being the "least lovable" of the aunts. (The reason for this was never explicitly stated.) She attended Remington Business College, and for most of her early adult life, she worked as a stenographer in Pittsburgh. By 1930, however, she had moved across the country, to Riverside, California. She got her degree in library work at the Riverside Library School, and then worked as an assistant librarian at the University of California's Citrus Experiment Station for thirty years.
