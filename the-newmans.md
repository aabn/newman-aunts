The story of the Newman women begins with their parents, Jacob Frieze Newman and Emma Stouffer Frantz. Jacob was originally from Maryland, but after his father died and his mother remarried, he journeyed to Waynesboro, a small town in southern Pennsylvania, to learn the miller's trade. There, he met and married Emma Frantz, the daughter of a miller herself, and one of the descendants of a prominent Mennonite family.

Jacob is described as a "character" and appears to have always been on the lookout for the next great opportunity. The family spent years moving from one town to the next, and at one point, according to stories, Jacob became convinced that he had to go West to win his fortune. Emma would not go with him, however, so he went by himself, returning some years later. The family eventually settled back in Waynesboro, and after Jacob retired from milling, he became the town's justice of the peace. Emma died in 1917, and Jacob died three years later, at the home of his daughter Babbie.

Although the focus of this project is on the "Newman women," there were three Newman men as well: Martin (1871-1926), Samuel (1882-1964), and Jacob (1890-1935). Martin, described as a man who had "left and right socks," moved away from the family as a young man and became a chemical engineer. Jacob worked in the steel and bronze industries and, sadly, committed suicide in 1935. Samuel, my great-grandfather, worked his way up from a machinist to president at the Landis Tool and Machine Companies. He married Matilda Omwake, and they had five children: Mary, Emma, Barbara, William (my grandfather), and Peggy.
